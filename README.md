# 30 characters of Python

Encode any Python program in just 30 characters*.

*\* Not taking whitespace into account.*

Run as `python3 30characters.py example.py` (or on any other script). This prints Python code to stdout.

How this works: [blog post](https://purplesyringa.moe/blog/any-python-program-fits-in-30-characters/).

This code is based on [PyFuck](https://github.com/kuangkzh/PyFuck) -- thank you!
